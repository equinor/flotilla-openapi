# Flotilla-openapi

A formated version of the API specification can be found [here](https://equinor.github.io/flotilla-openapi/).

To generate locally: Follow the description in the [pythonpublish.yml](.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml) workflow except the last step.

## Editing API-specification

For editing the API-specification in `openapi.yaml` the [openapi-editor](https://github.com/Codermar/openapi-editor) can be used. This can be installed by running `npm -g install openapi-editor`. To edit the file run `npx openapi-editor --file openapi.yaml`.
